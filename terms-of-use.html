            OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS AS DETAILED IN THE “MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND
            CLASS ACTION WAIVER” SECTION BELOW. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND
            ACCESS TO THE PLATFORM (DEFINED BELOW) ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING
            TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE
            OR ACCESS THE PLATFORM IN ANY MANNER.
          </p>
          <p>
            Welcome to CandidApp LLC. (“CANDID”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). Please
            read on to learn the terms, rules, and restrictions (“Terms of Use”
            or “Terms”) that govern your use of our products, services, and
            platform (referred to collectively as the “CANDID” or "Platform").
            For purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” mean the Platform
            account creator, authorized signer, authorized representative,
            delegate, and/or other authorized Platform user, including
            co-applicant. The Platform allows users to provide information that
            banks, mortgage companies, and other lenders (“Financial Services
            Providers”) use to process loan applications and offer other
            financial services to you. CANDID is not a lender or loan broker,
            and does not make lending or credit decisions on behalf of Financial
            Services Providers. The Platform does not constitute an offer or
            solicitation to lend.
          </p>
          <p>
            These Terms of Use are a legal agreement between you and CANDID. The
            Terms include the provisions below, as well as those in the Privacy
            Policy. You acknowledge and agree that, by accessing or using the
            Platform or by uploading or posting any content to the Platform, you
            are indicating that you have read and understand, and agree to be
            bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you
            have no right to access or use the Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may, from time to time, modify these Terms, including the Privacy
            Policy. If so, we will post the updated Terms on the Platform. If
            you do not agree to, or cannot comply with, the modified Terms, you
            must stop using the Platform. The updated Terms will take effect
            after their posting and will apply on a going-forward basis, unless
            otherwise provided in a notice to you, and except as provided in the
            “Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver” section of these
            Terms. Your continued use of the Platform after any such update
            constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Joint Applicants.</strong> If you are using the Platform
            with another person to apply jointly for a loan or other financial
            services product, you and your co-applicant may choose to provide
            information for your application using a single joint account or
            multiple individual Platform account(s). If joint applicants choose
            to utilize a single Platform account, they will have access to all
            information supplied by Platform account users to complete that
            application. Such joint applicants will have the ability to view,
            print, transmit, save, and/or edit the information. Access may
            continue for as long as the joint applicants utilize the single
            Platform account in connection with the application process.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these
